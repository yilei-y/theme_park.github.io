## The tentative project title:

Impact of the Pandemic on the Attendance of Theme Parks/Museums in the
United States

## The motivation for this project:

Theme parks and museums are significant contributors to the tourism and
entertainment industry. Understanding how attendance has been affected
provides insights into the economic impact of the pandemic on these
sectors.

Studying attendance patterns is essential for understanding how public
health concerns, such as the fear of infection, impact peopleâ€™s
willingness to visit crowded places. This information is valuable for
future planning and addressing safety concerns.

Analyzing attendance data can provide insights into how the impact of
the pandemic on theme parks and museums in the United States compares to
other countries. This comparative analysis helps in understanding the
global dynamics of the tourism and entertainment industries.

## The intended final products:

Interactive website to indicate the changes of attendance of the Theme
Parks, including: Introduction: The overall impact of the epidemic on
the pedestrian flow of theme parks, Analysis: Quantitative visualization
of the impact of pandemic on theme parks and museums and comparison
